    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    
    <p>Currently, I am enrolled in the second semester at Boston University in the Computer Engineering program. I have taken and will be taking several courses which continue to enhance my programming skills and make me well versed in this field. Although my undergraduate background contrasts with my chosen graduate major, it only helps as it teaches me to never give up and tackle the assigned tasks with determination. This attitude will bring about productivity to the firm while helping me get the right experience in order to build the foundation of my career.
    </p>
    <p>I am proficient with programming languages and tools such as Java,C++,python,HTML and JS. I have also worked on several projects, as a part of my coursework and in industries as well. The projects that I have worked on spanned different domains and specializations making me versatile enough to make the most of every opportunity presented to me. Apart from this, I am a quick learner and can switch between working in a team to working single-handedly with ease.
